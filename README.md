# MacOS Sort Screenshots

A bash script to sort MacOS screenshots.

## How to use

This script takes a single argument: the default directory for saving screenshots on your system. An example of how the script can be set up as a cron job is detailed in `example-cron.txt`

## Notes

1. If your default screenshot directory is a protected folder, you will need to provide the `cron` binary with full disk access
